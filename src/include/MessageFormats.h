// The ESP is the SPI master because it doesn't have a DMA facility. In practice, the ESP initiates an SPI transaction only when the SAM asks it to.
// The SAM and the ESP first exchange headers. Then the ESP looks at the header, decodes the command from the SAM, and exchanges a response dword.
// If the ESP accepted the command, it then does an appropriate data transfer.
// The SAM uses DMA to transfer the whole message, so it can only transfer the entire message.
